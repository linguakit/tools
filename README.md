## English "Pronunciation"
### Arabic
We have partnered with an Arabic speaker to create [linguakit/arabic](https://github.com/linguakit/arabic).
### Chinese
Personally, we prefer [Overtrue's Pinyin library](https://github.com/overtrue/pinyin]) ([English Docs](https://github-com.translate.goog/overtrue/pinyin/blob/master/README.md?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)).
### Japanese
We have not used this library yet, but it looks promising. [nihongodera/limelight](https://github.com/nihongodera/limelight).
### Other languages
More languages coming soon!
