### Arabic
We have partnered with an Arabic speaker to create (linguakit/arabic)[https://github.com/linguakit/arabic].
### Chinese
Personally, we prefer (Overtrue's Pinyin library)[https://github.com/overtrue/pinyin] ((English Docs)[https://github-com.translate.goog/overtrue/pinyin/blob/master/README.md?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp]).
